## 1. Project Structure
Maintain a clean and organized project structure:

```plaintext
├── public/            # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── components/    # Reusable components
│   ├── pages/         # Next.js pages
│   ├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
│   ├── styles/        # Global styles
│   ├── utils/         # Utility functions
│   └── types/         # TypeScript types and interfaces
└── tests/             # Unit and integration tests
```

## 2. Naming Conventions
### Files and Directories
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names: my-component tsx, user-profile.ts.
- Use PascalCase for React components and TypeScript types/interfaces: MyComponent, UserProfile.

### Variables and Functions
- Use camelCase for variable and function names: fetchData, handleSubmit.
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants: MAX_RETRIES, API_BASE_URL.

## 3. TypeScript Best Practices
- Always use TypeScript for all files (.tsx for React components and .ts for others).
- Avoid using any type. Explicitly define types wherever possible.
- Use unknown instead of any when type checking is needed.
Prefer type aliases for simple types and interfaces for object shapes.

Example:

```typescript
type UserId = string;

interface User {
  id: UserId;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

## 4. Next.js Best Practices
- Leverage Next.js built-in features like getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, and API routes.
- Use dynamic routing with care, following the Next.js dynamic routing documentation.
- Keep API routes RESTful and adhere to HTTP standards.
## 5. React Best Practices
- Use functional components and React Hooks.
Keep components small and focused. If a component grows too large, consider splitting it.
- Use memoization (React.memo, useCallback, useMemo) to optimize performance.
- Prop drilling should be avoided by using context or custom hooks where appropriate.
## 6. Component and File Organization
- Group related files (e.g., component, styles, and tests) in the same directory:
```plaintext
src/
└── components/
    └── Button/
        ├── Button.tsx
        ├── Button.test.tsx
        ├── Button.module.css
        └── index.ts
```
Index files should be used for exporting components to simplify imports.

## 7. Styling and CSS
- Use CSS Modules or styled-components for component-scoped styles.
- Follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) convention when using traditional CSS.
- Keep global styles in a single styles/global.css or similar file.
- Prefer Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI for utility-first or component-based styling.

## 8. Linting and Formatting
- Use ESLint with TypeScript support to enforce coding standards.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.


## 9. Version Control
- Follow the Gitflow branching model:
main branch for production-ready code.
develop branch for ongoing development.
Feature branches (feature/xyz) for individual tasks.
Commit messages should be concise and descriptive. Use Conventional Commits format.

## 10.  Testing
- Write unit tests for all critical components and functions.
- Use Jest with React Testing Library for testing React components.
- Organize tests in the tests/ directory, mirroring the project structure.
- Aim for high test coverage and avoid testing implementation details.
## 11.  Documentation
- Document all public functions, components, and utilities using JSDoc or TypeScript comments.
- Maintain a README.md with clear instructions on setup, development, and deployment.
- Keep this STYLE_GUIDE.md updated with any changes to coding standards.

## 12.  Performance Optimization
- Use lazy loading and code splitting to optimize page load times.
- Optimize images using Next.js Image component and consider using a CDN for asset delivery.
- Monitor and improve performance using Lighthouse and Next.js built-in tools.

## 13.  Security Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server-side.
- Use HTTPS and secure cookies for sensitive data.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Store secrets using environment variables and secure them in production.

## 14.  Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
- Regularly test the application with screen readers and other accessibility tools.
